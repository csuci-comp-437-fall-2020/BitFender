Dipplenemy is a stationary enemy with uniquely camouflaging skin features making it a difficult enemy for the player to detect visibly. It is a ranged enemy. If the player is within its vicinity, its eyes will lid up and starts shooting the player with lighting bolts and return to sleep when no player is nearby. It is a dangerous enemy when coming close in-contact. Due to its cloaking feature, if the player were to come in physical contact, it will turn its body into a proximity bomb (three seconds tick until self-destruct). Self-destruct works similar to Creeper in Minecraft (inspiration, yay!).
